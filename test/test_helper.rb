  # NOTE: Because helper methods aren’t available in tests, we can’t use
  # the 'current_user' method, but the 'session' method is available, so
  # we use that instead. Here we use 'fixture_logged_in?' instead of
  # 'logged_in?' so that the test helper and Sessions helper methods
  # have different names, which prevents them from being mistaken for
  # each other.
